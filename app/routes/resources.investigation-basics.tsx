				<p>
					The first step to investigations is to have a location in
					mind. Locations can be categorized under either indoor or
					outdoor. Both scenes offer different experiences and require
					different subsets of equipment. Indoor is usually quieter
					with less wind, so experiments can be controlled easier.
					Indoor might also narrow searches within a location to
					frequent reported experiences. However, outdoor locations
					offer a unique sense of freedom and wilderness, especially
					in the dark, so you may be immersed more! That said, outdoor
					might be for the more experienced investigator, due to the
					extra elements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether it be indoor or outdoor, you and your team will most
					likely need permission. As long as you are not trespassing
					or overstaying your welcome, you should be okay. Some
					outdoor locations, like public or national parks, are closed
					after dusk and are difficult to obtain clearance to stay. I
					would start by reaching out to existing community societies,
					parks and recreation of the particular township, or park
					and/or museum offices. If there is no appointed office or
					representative, I recommend getting in touch with the local
					police. Whichever location you intend to investigate, make
					sure you start the communication process for access well in
					advance of your intended investigation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some locations, especially outdoor or abandoned buildings,
					may not offer typical accommodations like bathrooms or
					electricity! So it's important to fully understand where you
					are going before you get there. Joining a guided tour is a
					great way for any investigator to gain access to locations,
					and the guides will know what's what. There are a few
					outstanding tour groups, such as{" "}
					<a href="http://www.strange-escapes.com/">
						Strange Escapes
					</a>
					, <a href="https://ghosthuntsusa.com/">Ghost Hunts USA</a>,
					and{" "}
					<a href="https://usghostadventures.com/">
						US Ghost Adventures
					</a>
					. If you are traveling far away, make sure you have proper
					accommodations as well. Hotels, campsites, or RVs are good
					to act as a home base. You can also create an itinerary to
					share with your team, so everyone knows what is planned and
					when. An example can be found <a href="#wip">here</a>. And
					as always, try to bring someone else with you!

				<p>
					Once your investigation is planned, you'll want to begin
					researching past personal experiences and site history. Keep
					a look out for events that may have caused great emotion,
					positive or negative, as these tend to result in residual
					energy. If you don't have a guide, be sure to check for
					internet or newspaper articles for the venue or site. If you
					can, speak to a local historian or check archives at the
					local library for more accurate accounts.
				</p>
				<p>
					After knowing a bit more about the location, list out
					questions you'd like to get answers to. Did you read about a
					particular death? A famous person? A large battle? Is there
					a common thread or personal experience a lot of people
					report on? Using information that is relevant to whoever or
					wherever you are trying to investigate is the best way to
					engage for responses. There are{" "}
					<a href="#experimental-techniques">techniques</a> below if
					you need some ideas for experiments!

				<h2 id="during-the-investigation">During the Investigation</h2>
				<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
				<p>
					At the start of an investigation is the Setup phase. This is
					where your team leaders should go over locale contact
					information, the team should set up or unpack any gear, and
					get any detailed information from the tour guides or
					representatives. If you also believe in prayer or
					incantations, now would be the time to do so.
				</p>
				<h3 id="briefing">Briefing</h3>
				<p>
					After setup, a quick Briefing should occur. Explain the
					locale and history and what to expect. Go over any previous
					notable experiences. Observe where restrooms will be
					located. And make sure everyone knows how to operate their
					gear properly. Next the team members responsible for
					research should talk about the Points of Interest. Identify
					a gear room to store your bags, cases, and identify it as a
					safe spot that is well lit. Caution teammates about
					hazardous spots or areas that are off-limits. You should
					also plan to investigate targeted or hot-spots.
				</p>
				<h3 id="logistics">Logistics</h3>
				<p>
					Once the team is briefed, teams should be organized, with at
					least two (2) investigators together at all times. I
					recommend no more than five (5) be part of a single
					experiment, however if orientation is required, have newbies
					tag along and observe for training. Suggest relevant
					experiments that teams can conduct throughout the evening.
					If certain activity is present, that may sway you to conduct
					different types of experiments. Also rule out any
					experiments that won't make sense for the locale, they will
					usually be obvious at the time, like conducting knocks in an
					open field, or dressing up to reenact in an abandoned house.
				</p>
				<h3 id="experimentations">Experimentations</h3>
				<p>
					Break out into your separate sessions and be wary of noise
					levels. Avoid being too loud if one team is close to another
					- especially in standard houses. If you think another team
					is contaminating a session, pause the session and notify
					them on radio or cell. Be sure to note down any false
					positives or accidents on recorders clearly.
				</p>
				<p>
					When conducting experiments, it's always better to settle in
					and get comfy. Find a nice chair or an intact bed before
					sitting on the ground. Don't force your team to be in
					complete darkness either - spirits will be around regardless
					of light! Before starting a recording session, greet
					whomever may be present, introduce yourselves and your
					intentions, and explain the devices you plan to use if you
					intend for supernatural interaction. Ask your questions
					clearly, with adequate pauses (around 30 seconds) in
					between, and be polite. Depending on the amount of members
					in a session, you can round-robin questions, employ a
					leader, or go back and forth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Be sure to also take breaks! Experimental sessions should
					usually not exceed 30 minutes, especially if no activity or
					sensations occur. Head back to the gear room to shuffle
					teams and head to different locations.
				</p>
				<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h3>
				<p>
					Once your allotted time has expired, or you find yourselves
					getting tired, begin to regroup at the gear room to debrief
					and tear down any equipment. Encourage the team to talk
					about their personal experiences. Did anyone review EVPs
					after a session? Did anyone witness movement or temperature
					sensations? Did anyone have their hair pulled? Anything
					abnormal should be reported and documented for clients - but
					not yet shared with them! Wrap up your investigation with
					overall thoughts and discussions of the time spent, then
					pack up and head out. If your team was part of a guided tour
					or a representative or caretaker sees you out, thank them
					for their time and for the access granted to the location.
					If reporting back to them with evidence, give them a time
					frame on when to expect it.

				<p>
					When the investigation is over, evidence review begins. Put
					on your comfy clothes, make a hot drink, and settle in for
					the hours of review ahead! Watch any recorded video, listen
					to audio, check timestamps and note down file names for any
					notable hits. Standard computer software for viewing video
					would suffice, some even have clip editing software. For
					audio files, we recommend{" "}
					<a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> as you
					can visualize waveforms and clip audio segments. Once all
					your evidence is reviewed, throw it into a shared storage
					like OneDrive, Google Drive, or DropBox for team members to
					access. If reporting back to a client, be sure to guide the
					review either on the phone or in person.
